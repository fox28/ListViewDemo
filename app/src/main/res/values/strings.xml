    <string name="content">It was the first day of class. Two of her new
        ESL classmates wanted to know where Tara was from. They were both from Iraq.
        Because Tara looked Iraqi, one of the women asked Tara, in English, if she was from Iraq.
        Tara replied, "No, I'm not." Then the women took turns asking Tara if she was from Iran, or Syria,
        or Jordan. To each question, Tara responded with a simple no. Laughing, one woman said to the other,
        "She's not from anywhere!" The two went to their desks, talking to each other in Arabic.</string>
